= Development: Bucket Reconciliation

This page gives a brief overview how `Buckets` are managed in the provider.

Note that these diagrams are on a high-level and don't visualize the path for every possible situation.

== Creating Buckets

- All bucket operations are done using any S3-compatible client library.
- In exoscale.com API, bucket names in a respective zone are unique per project.

== Updating Buckets

- Since renaming buckets and changing region is not possible, there's nothing to update once the bucket exists.
- Immutable fields are going through the validating webhook server first.
  This prevents changing the spec once the bucket exists.

== Deleting Buckets

- Deleting bucket is a synchronous operation.
